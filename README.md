## What is this?

This is a tiny web application I built to learn the basics of Flask. It's a
careers website for a fictive company, Nexa Funds - a fintech that "innovative,
customer-centric financial solutions that empower people and businesses to
achieve their financial goals".

## Is this company real?

Nope. It was created by ChatGPT - my prompt was:

> I need a fictive company in the fintech space. Generate a name, tagline,
> mission and vision statements, three paragraphs copy for the "about us" page,
> and provide me with a Dall-E prompt that would generate the logo of the
> company.

This is what I got back:
